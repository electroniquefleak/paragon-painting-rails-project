<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a demo application for Flatiron School's Phase 3 project cycle.

While determining the best method to exhibit my compounded knowledge of Rails, I wanted my project to emulate a real world example of how to demonstrate object-oriented programming.

With that in mind, I chose something that was both personal to me; and a user utilizing my application: I created an application with my uncle's commercial painting business in mind - Paragon Painting & Waterproofing.

Here's why:
* The construction industry is one that rarely employs technology to oversee organization of crew members.
* With that in mind, I developed an in-house organizational resource for project crews, allowing them to view projects they were assigned to; in the form of teams.
* Users are divided by two roles, Employees & Admins: Employees have permissions to view projects and its associated teams; Admins have permissions to create, edit, and destroy both projects and user roles (teams).

With that in mind, I believe that using the Rails framework fulfilled the necessities of my application; while fulfilling Flatiron's project requirements. The following documentation will provide new users with a means to setting up the server and offering additional insight on the application's development.
